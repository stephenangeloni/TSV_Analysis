1. Create a web page for analyzing TSV (Tab-Separated Values) files.
2. The page should have the following elements:
   - A file input for uploading TSV files
   - A "Clear" button to reset the page
   - A results display area
   - dropdown menus for filtering on the columns but only up to 10000 values
   - A filtered results display area
 
3. Implement the following functionality:
   - File parsing: Read and parse the uploaded TSV file
   - Column analysis: Count distinct values in each column and use that to determine if a dropdown is ok or if it should be an input box
   - Filtering: Allow users to filter data based on selected dropdown values or for the input box, the elements that contain that value. Make that comparison case insensitive.
   - Clear functionality: Reset all filters
 
4. Optimize for performance:
   - Use efficient data structures (e.g., Set for counting distinct values)
   - Minimize DOM updates by using javascript variables to hold the data until that data is ready to be put into a dom element in one go for bulk updates
   - Use event delegation where appropriate
   - Implement lazy loading for dropdown options
 
5. Include timing measurements for performance analysis in the console log
 
6. Style the page for readability:
   - Use a clean, simple layout
   - Set a maximum width for better readability on large screens
   - Use appropriate spacing between elements
 
7. Ensure the page is responsive and works on different screen sizes
 
8. Use vanilla JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks
 
9. Include appropriate error handling and user feedback
